I dont like hyphens-only, I like underscores for things between phrases, and hyphens for things within phrases.

For example, the filename reads better as: `2020-05-10_my-first-blog-post.md`. 

What if I wanted to begin my title with a number? Which reads better?

1) `2020-05-10_10-reasons-microsoft-must-drop-ICE-contracts.md`

or,

2) `2020-05-10-10-reasons-microsoft-must-drop-ICE-contracts.md`

Obviously, underscores simply are better. They are good. Hyphens only are bad. This is tech blogging!!!
