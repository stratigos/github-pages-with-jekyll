# This tutorial is kind of borked

Although it seems to be the only up-to-date place to figure out how to do the "easy" thing and blog on GitHub where Microsoft owns your content although for some reason they pretend not to.

I am confused by the extreme level of hand holding, given that I cant imagine a non-technologist would prefer to blog on Github. I guess Ill just keep chanting "Microsoft won, this is the future..." over and over until I accept that.

Remember when free software meant freedom?
